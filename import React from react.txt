MMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:
Priority 1 (Must Fix):
Build the backend API (Express + PostgreSQL/MySQL)
Implement auto-calculation for Fuel Record balance
Fix duplicate code in LPODetailForm
Create database schema linking DO → Fuel Record → LPO
Priority 2 (Should Have):
Implement LPO-to-Fuel-Record linkage display
Add fuel consumption analytics dashboard
Create reporting for fuel costs vs routes
Implement station/yard master data management
Priority 3 (Nice to Have):
Real-time fuel tracking
Mobile-responsive optimizations
Automated alerts for low balance or unusual consumption
Historical trend analysis

things to work on 
put an excel like interface exactlly to my codes for easy lpo making and 

today - 
store the destinations and from details of truck before do creation of export type so that when it is changed it doesn't vanish and can be used in lpo creation

whats remaining in lpo
in the workbook should be able to edit values as truck number, liters destination and everything and save and enable auto fetch
